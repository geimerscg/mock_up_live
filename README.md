# My Portfolio Project


I started by building the basic structure of the page with the html.  I divided each section of the page
into a box that I was able to manipulate with css.  This made for easy formatting of the page lay out.


I used flexbox for ease of formatting the lay out.  After deciding on the lay out, I added in the
content and adjusted the css. I set break points at 500px and 768px after seeing the how the content
expanded. At 500 the project boxes roll up to form a row.  At 768 I set a margin and centered all the
content as well.
